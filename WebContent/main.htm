	<h3>About UID</h3>
	<p>Unique identity solution to the unoptimized and perplexed
	identification system in india.</p>
	<p>This system provides the functionality of a uniformed , globally connected identification system. In this, the citizen needs to get his documents verified only once instead of similiar repetitive task in the older system.
	With this all other government related processes, such as driving license application and passport application become short and easier as one step of document verification has already been done.</p>
	<p>Besides, the system also provide a way to keep control over transit status of every citizen. Thus if a criminal is on the run, then his status is set to not-allowed and can be captured on the airport when he tries to travel.</p>
